# Whack Stack (a Tetris clone)

After deleting the 2 abandoned, non-functional Tetris-clone folders, I went to the repo to see what kind of
textures the game had.  After looking at the textures, I started thinking 
about the logic involved in this kind of game, and thought it might be fairly easy to write 
(from scratch) without taking too much time.
