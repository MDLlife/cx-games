# Whacky Stack 
(a Tetris clone)

Make sure you have this entire folder on your hard drive.
Then run it with the command "cx .", in the main folder of the game.

The version of CX that is most certain to work can be gotten here:
https://github.com/skycoin/cx/releases/tag/v0.7.0


# NOTE
After deleting the 2 abandoned, non-functional Tetris-clone folders, I went back in the repo history to see what kind of textures the game had.  After looking at the textures, I started thinking about the logic involved in this kind of game, and thought it might be fairly easy to write (from scratch) without taking too much time.
